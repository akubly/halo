## 2026-06-07: Theme-2 Synesthetic Familiar as First Official Halo Project — ACCEPTED
**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Owner:** Hiro (Architect), Aaron (final approval)  
**Date:** 2026-06-07  
**Scope:** Establishes Synesthetic Familiar (Theme-2) as first official Halo playground demo; locks architectural approach

**Decision:** Synesthetic Familiar is the first official Halo playground project. Architecture follows host-peripheral model: Python host (mood inference from mic+IMU) → Lua device (render breathing sprite). 8 core architectural choices are locked:

1. **Host-Peripheral Architecture Confirmed** — Python host drives inference; Lua device renders. No deviation from Brilliant's canonical model.

2. **Autonomy Tier: Hybrid Host-Primary** — Host handles mood inference; device interpolates/renders locally. Device has IMU-only fallback if BLE drops. Latency budget 200-500ms achievable.

3. **Mood/Render Decoupling** — Mood calculation = pure function `compute_mood(sensors) → { mood_enum, intensity, confidence }`. Rendering = pure Lua with no shared state. Enables future renderer swaps and independent unit testing.

4. **Confidence Gating: Silence is Safer** — If mood confidence < 0.7, system holds current Familiar state rather than displaying uncertain values. Gate applied host-side before BLE transmission.

5. **Privacy by Abstraction** — Familiar uses abstract visual language (breathing, color, orbit speed) with no labeled emotions, text, or explicit biometric indicators. Visual jitter (5-10%) prevents statistical inference. Satisfies lighter Theme-2 privacy requirements.

6. **BLE Protocol: FAMILIAR_UPDATE (0x80)** — Custom opcode carrying mood_enum (1B), intensity (1B), confidence (1B), sequence (2B) = 6 bytes total in single BLE packet. No raw biometric data transmitted.

7. **Display Budget: Within Constraints** — 24×24 sprite at 7 o'clock, 80% radius. Idle ~1.5% lit, calm ~3%, stressed ~2.5% — all well under 30% canvas limit.

8. **Graceful Degradation Hierarchy** — Sensor failure fallback: (1) Mic+IMU → full inference; (2) Mic-only → 0.7 confidence cap; (3) IMU-only → 0.6 cap; (4) Both fail → hold 10s, then neutral. No freeze or error state.

**Rationale:** Architecture aligns with decisions.md (hosted multimodal API, device portability, privacy-by-abstraction, M55 gate-keeping role). Hiro validated against LIBRARIAN-T2-5-ERROR, RAVEN-T2-1, and DASID-T2-1 user stories.

## 2026-06-07: Theme-2 Synesthetic Familiar — 3 Key Decisions Locked by Aaron
**Status:** APPROVED  
**Owner:** Hiro (Architect), Aaron (final decision)  
**Date:** 2026-06-07  
**Approval Date:** 2026-06-07  
**Related:** Theme-2 Synesthetic Familiar ARD (2026-06-07)

Aaron approved 3 critical architectural decisions for Synesthetic Familiar v1 (Theme-2 first official Halo playground project). These decisions are now LOCKED and drive the Week 1–3 milestone sequence.

**Decision 1: Sensors for v1 — Mic + IMU (LOCKED)**
- Mic + IMU provides good inference signal for stress/calm detection (voice tone + motion)
- No camera in v1 eliminates privacy overhead and complexity
- Rationale: Proven sufficient for v1 "feels alive" bar; camera deferred to Phase 2

**Decision 2: Mood Model — Local Heuristic (LOCKED)**
- Local heuristic on host (no cloud for v1)
- Rationale: Latency (200-500ms local vs. 500-2000ms cloud) essential for ambient display; privacy (no telemetry); reliability (no network dependency)
- Cloud refinement deferred to Phase 2

**Decision 3: Creature Form — Abstract-with-Eyes (LOCKED)**
- Abstract geometric form with single bright eye (no face, no anthropomorphic features)
- Rationale: Recognizable as creature but abstract enough that bystanders cannot read wearer internal state; preserves privacy (RAVEN-T2-1)

**Consequences:**
- ARD now build-ready (status APPROVED in docs/projects/synesthetic-familiar/ARD.md)
- Phase 1 milestone sequence locked: Week 1 "It moves" (render loop), Week 2 "It reacts" (host inference), Week 3 "It's alive" (UX + polish)
- Tech stack finalized: Python 3.11 host + Lua device render + local heuristic (no cloud, no ML framework)
- Privacy by abstraction confirmed (abstract visuals, no biometric leak, on-device inference)

**Next Step:** Week 1 "It moves" — Python host harness + Lua sprite render on Halo device.
